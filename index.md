## Java Chess Game

This is a modified version of chess game written in Java. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows two players to play a full game of chess against each other. The game also includes login functionality, allowing users to create an account or continue as a guest. Upon logging in, players are taken to a game setup page where they can select their names and the time for each player. The game ends when a player puts the other's king in checkmate, the game ends in a tie, or when the timer for one of the players ends.
## Installation

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sbme-tutorials/finalproject_chessgame-team-two.git
- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
- Build and run the project.
## Usage
- Start the game by running the main class Main.java.
- The game will display a login screen. Users can either log in if they have an account or continue as a guest.
- If a user chooses to log in, they will be prompted to enter their username and password. If they do not have an account, they can create one by clicking on the "Sign Up" button.
- Once a user is logged in, they will be taken to the game setup page where they can select their names and the time for each player.
- After selecting their names and time, players can click on the "Start" button to begin playing.
- Players take turns to move their pieces by clicking on the piece they want to move and then clicking on the square they want to move it to.
- The game will validate the move and update the board accordingly.
- The game continues until one player puts the other's king in checkmate, the game ends in a tie, or when the timer for one of the players ends.
Modifications
## This version of chess includes the following modifications:

- Pawn capture: A pawn can capture (eat) the squares diagonally or the piece in front.
- Bishop special move: The bishop can only move three steps on the diagonal and bypass any pieces. The bishop also has a new special move, which is to move one square on the horizontal axis so it changes the diagonal color.
- Knight move: The knight can move in an L shape, with two squares horizontally or vertically, and then three squares in the perpendicular direction.
